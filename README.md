- Key terms and obligations are often missed.
- Inconsistent evaluations across different reviewers.

### AI-Powered Solution
The Smart Contract Analysis Platform combines **Upstage's Document Parse API** and **Solar LLM** to deliver enterprise-grade contract analysis:
1. **Document Parse Integration**:
   - Automatically extracts text from uploaded contracts (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT).
   - Preserves document structure and formatting.
   - Handles complex legal document layouts with high accuracy.
2. **Solar LLM Analysis**:
   - Performs comprehensive legal analysis with advanced reasoning.
   - Extracts key contract terms (parties, dates, financial terms, obligations).
   - Conducts risk assessment with specific risk factors and recommendations.
   - Generates a concise executive summary for quick decision-making.

### Key Features

- **📋 Key Terms Extraction**:
  - Parties: Identifies contracting entities and their roles (e.g., Landlord/Tenant, Buyer/Seller).
  - Financial Terms: Extracts total value, payment schedules, penalties, and deposits.
  - Important Dates: Captures effective dates, expiration, renewal, and milestones.
  - Termination Clauses: Details exit conditions and procedures.
- **👥 Obligation Mapping**:
  - Clear breakdown of each party's responsibilities and deliverables.
  - Organized by party with deadlines for easy review.
- **📄 Enhanced Analysis Features**:

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
- **Backend**: Express.js with Upstage API integration (Document Parse, Solar LLM).
- **File Processing**: Supports PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT formats with a 50MB limit.
- **AI Pipeline**: Document Parse extracts text, Solar LLM provides structured analysis.
- **Debugging Support**:
  - Logs file information (name, size, type).
  - Tracks API response status and structure.
  - Reports text extraction details (length, first 500 characters).
  - Provides comprehensive error details if no text is found.

### Debugging Tips
If you encounter issues during document upload, check the browser console (F12 → Console tab) for:
- **Document Parse API Response**: Verify the response contains the expected `elements` array and text content.
- **Response Structure**: Ensure `elements` or `content.text` exists and contains valid data.
- **Error Details**: Look for logs indicating why text extraction failed (e.g., unsupported format, empty document).
- **Text Extraction Logic**: Confirm the extraction logic is accessing the correct fields (`elements`, `content.text`, `content.html`).

This helps identify whether the issue is with the API response, document parsing, or text extraction logic.
